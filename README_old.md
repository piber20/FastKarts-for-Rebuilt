# GameMode_FASTKarts
This is a GameMode Add-On for the indie game Blockland.

Blockland is an online multiplayer game where you build things with bricks.
It's like playing with legos on the internet.
More info: http://blockland.us/

The FASTKarts gamemode is more than just your standard everyday speedkart edit, much more than just adding a /boombox command was done here. Many features have been ported from DeathMatch gamemode to this, and this took lots of effort to get working nicely by all parties involved.

Many of the gamemode's features can be controlled with preferences that can be changed ingame through server commands or a preferences editing mod, like Return to Blockland or Support_Preferences. Get started by typing /help ingame.

# File structure
./core/
- This directory contains the core functioning files required for the gamemode to run and play as it does. Without this, there would be no gamemode to play in any condition.

./custom/
- This directory contains custom made add-on files that have been made for the gamemode or with the gamemode in mind. Assets or coding for datablocks are contained here.
- These have better potential into being made standalone add-ons, or already are.

./addons/
- This directory contains integrated add-on files which have been modified for use within this gamemode.

./server.cs
- This file is required for the gamemode to run, and the gamemode itself is listed in the gamemode.txt which executes this file as a result.

# Contributing
The gamemode is at a "completed" state, but you can still help by fixing bugs or adding some quality-of-life features. Feel free to create pull requests and we'll take a look at it!
