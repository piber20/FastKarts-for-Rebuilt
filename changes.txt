v10:

Use Old Names pref is now more descriptive, shows up as "Rename SuperKarts to SpeedKarts" in rtb/glass prefs

You can now load music from the custom gamemode (pref is disabled by default)

You are now told to check the /download command if you have no tracks loaded

Gamemode is now playable without any track, the Lighthouse track is loaded by default. You will still get messages about needing to download maps, though
