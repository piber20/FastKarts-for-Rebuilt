# FastKarts for Rebuilt

This project is a sort of addendum made almost 8 years after the last update of the Blockland gamemode FASTKarts to fix a few things and to make it work better with Blockland Rebuilt and to reignite a sort of nostalgic feeling for the original developer.

Blockland Rebuilt is a revival and archival of Blockland, a version forked from the source with lots of fixes and updates and marries the maps of v20 with the shaders of v21.

# File structure
./core/
- This directory contains the core functioning files required for the gamemode to run and play as it does. Without this, there would be no gamemode to play in any condition.

./custom/
- This directory contains custom made add-on files that have been made for the gamemode or with the gamemode in mind. Assets or coding for datablocks are contained here.
- These have better potential into being made standalone add-ons, or already are.

./addons/
- This directory contains integrated add-on files which have been modified for use within this gamemode.

./server.cs
- This is the first file that is executed when the gamemode starts.
